DESCRIPTION:When you are familiar with AL code and writing extensions for 
 Business Central\, there might be the feeling that there is more to disco
 ver. There are features in AL that you may have come across but never use
 d because you don’t exactly know how they work. Or you wonder if you are 
 using the full potential of the AL language.Then this course is for you!I
 n one day\, we will cover many features that will fill up your AL toolbel
 t! Just to pick a few: interfaces\, partial records\, collecting errors\,
  deep dive into events\, and much\, much more!\nPrerequisites:\nWorkshop

DESCRIPTION:A good performing application is one of the main things that w
 ill make users happy\, although\, identifying and solving performance rel
 ated issues can be a daunting task. How can you confirm when users say "i
 t is slow"? What are the actions you can take to prevent performance issu
 es? What are actions that would be able to identify the problems - to put
  the finger on the wound? How can you solve it? …This workshop will provi
 de answers to questions like that! Because it is a simple fact: the most 
 probable cause of ANY performance issue at customers\, is code! Once you 
 accept that - you are a very big step forward in solving the issues as we
 ll.In this workshop\, we'll look into performance problems\, into the too
 ls to predict\, confirm and analyse them\, and into techniques on how to 
 prevent and solve them.\nPrerequisites:\nWorkshop date: Tue 20 or Wed 21

 ssues faster or can give input on how Business Central is being used. It 
 also can help with troubleshooting performance issues.During the training
 \, we will cover:1. How to start with telemetry - what are the possibilit
 ies\, what are the limitations\, how to set it up2. How to write queries 
 for the telemetry (KQL) and get more information from the Azure Applicati
 on Insights3. How to build alerts and notifications for the telemetry sig
 nals4. How to use telemetry for performance tuning and troubleshooting5. 
 How to build custom signals in AL to get more information about your user
 s and how they use the apps6. How to manage costs of the telemetry\nPrere

DESCRIPTION:Interfaces are not new in AL\, but after a few years of being 
 around\, they are still heavily underused both by Microsoft and by the co
 mmunity. And yet\, they are possibly the best single addition to AL stack
  in the recent years\, with potential to transform your coding style to o
 ther dimension.This workshop will go deep into interfaces and show you ho
 w to make the best out of them\, with a lot of practical examples\, rangi
 ng from simple to advanced. You’ll get hands on about how to scale your c
 ode\, make it more extensible and robust. Since interfaces have their spe
 cial place in testability\, you’ll learn how to use interfaces to make yo
 ur code more testable\, and how to take advantage of interfaces in your t
 est code as well.\nPrerequisites:\nWorkshop date: Tue 20 or Wed 21 June (

DESCRIPTION:Feature management is a modern software-development practice t
 hat decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick chan
 ges to feature availability on demand. It uses a technique called feature
  flags (also known as feature toggles and feature switches) to dynamicall
 y administer a feature's lifecycle.Feature management helps developers ad
 dress the following problems: How to handle code branching when your team
  have to do fixes and new functionality simultaneously? How to test multi
 ple isolated changes within actual customer data? How do rollback changes
  with minimal downtime and effort? How can some users try new features on
  production without breaking others?Tharanga Chandrasekara\, Lead Technic
 al Consultant at Theta (NZ) and Business Central MVP for the past seven y
 ears\, together with Volodymyr Leonov\, Technical Lead at Theta (NZ)\, wi
 ll take the audience through a short overview of the "trunk-based" and fe
 ature flag approach.Then the presenters will present how Microsoft uses B
 usiness Central Feature Management functionality to handle and control br
 aking changes for 100K+ SaaS customers.Presenters will demonstrate how a 
 standard delivery pipeline changes when you spice it with feature managem
 ent\, diving deep into coding practices and toolsets. Toolset includes an
  open-source extension that partners can start using right away.Attendees
  can take home a few great ideas on delivering sound solutions faster and
  illuminating waits within a complete delivery cycle.Topics:\n\nSpeaker(s

DESCRIPTION:In the words of Abraham Maslow\, the law of the instrument sta
 tes that if we have a hammer\, we tend to see everything as a nail. When 
 it comes to Business Central\, the Testing Framework IS a hammer that can
  help you identify and fix issues you encounter throughout normal operati
 ons.Unleash the full potential of your Business Central toolbox with Test
 ability and TestRunners - while these tools are undoubtedly essential for
  ensuring your code works\, you may be surprised to learn that they can a
 lso give your Business Central lifecycle a major boost in many other ways
 . From debugging to optimization\, your testability expertise can take yo
 ur Business Central game to the next level.Discover how to accelerate you
 r demos like Microsoft is doing with Contoso\, streamline your training a
 nd self-onboarding processes\, and even create powerful diagnostics and s
 upport applications.\n\nSpeaker(s): Jeremy Vyska

DESCRIPTION:One of the common (and top requested) requirements of a Dynami
 cs 365 Business Central ERP project is executing custom code in the cloud
  for serverless integrations or re-using .NET add-ins in a cloud-complian
 t way. For these tasks\, Azure Function is often the response.But using A
 zure Functions efficiently is not just deploying a code in the cloud. For
  a successful implementation\, there's more than this.Are you using Azure
  Functions at best? Are you working for scalability and reliability? Are 
 your functions secure? Are you using the latest technologies? Are your fu
 nction apps ready for the future? Are you optimizing costs?In this sessio
 n we’ll explore present and future of Azure Functions with the focus on D
 365BC projects. We’ll see how to efficiently use Azure Functions in a Dyn
 amics 365 Business Central project. We'll explore the in-process and isol
 ated model\, we'll see deployment options\, tips for scalability\, reliab
 ility and security\, how to integrate Azure Functions and Dataverse for c
 omplex ERP to Power Platform integrations and we'll see how to use them f
 rom AL code or for replacing standard ERP tools.\n\nSpeaker(s): Stefano D

  it might matter for BC. We'll look into use cases both in the backend an
 d in the frontend.\nIn the second part of this session\, we will dive int

DESCRIPTION:There has never been a feature in AL language that was at the 
 same time so amazingly powerful\, and yet so unbelievably underused\, bot
 h by Microsoft and by the partner community at large. When they were intr
 oduced in BC16 one could have expected that their use in the base app and
  the system app would explode. Any major product written in a language th
 at supports interfaces typically has more interfaces than classes\, yet w
 e\, in the base app have one interface per more than one hundred codeunit
 s. It’s an opportunity lost.This session will aim to demonstrate the grea
 t power of the interface type in AL. You will see how you can use them th
 e way Microsoft had in mind when they added them to the AL technical stac
 k. But that’s not all! You will see interfaces from a completely differen
 t angle\, and you will see how they make things possible that neither Mic
 rosoft nor you have probably ever considered. And the best of all is that
  it won’t be just some AL acrobatics for showing off on stage at TechDays
  – absolutely not! You will see how interfaces allow you to build cleanes
 t\, most maintainable\, and highest quality AL code ever.And – just for g
 ood measure – we’ll add a pinch of testability to it. You will see why in
 terfaces make for the most testable code out there and how you can apply 
 a few simple test patterns to take both your app and test code to the nex
 t level\, that would not be remotely possible without interfaces.\n\nSpea

DESCRIPTION:Upgrading to the latest version of Business Central on Cloud c
 an be a daunting task for many companies. With an ever-evolving cloud lan
 dscape\, companies are often faced with the challenge of upgrading to the
  latest version of Business Central on the Cloud while ensuring their exi
 sting data and processes remain intact.It is important to understand the 
 various challenges that come with upgrading to the latest version of BC o
 n the Cloud. The most common challenge is the potential for data loss dur
 ing the upgrade process. Companies must also consider the compatibility o
 f their existing third-party applications and integrations with the new v
 ersion of BC on the Cloud. If the necessary changes are not made\, the th
 ird-party applications and integrations may not work after the upgrade.De
 spite the challenges of upgrading to the latest version of BC on the Clou
 d\, there are also several best practices that can help ensure the upgrad
 e process is successful\, which we will cover in this session.We as an ex
 perienced company that is doing a lot of upgrade projects can share real-
 world Challenges and issues to ensure the upgrade process is successful a
 nd minimize any potential risks for others who try to upgrade its product
 s.Upgrading to the latest version of Business Central on Cloud can be a c
 omplex and time-consuming process. However\, by following the best practi
 ces shown in the session\, companies can ensure the upgrade process is su
 ccessful and their data remains intact. Companies should also ensure that
  any necessary third-party applications and integrations are compatible w
 ith the new version of BC on Cloud before proceeding with the upgrade. By
  following these best practices\, companies can ensure their upgrade to t
 he latest version of BC on Cloud is successful and their data remains com
 plete and secure.\n\nSpeaker(s): Stefan Šošić\, Nemanja Kutlesic
