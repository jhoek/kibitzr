DESCRIPTION:Integrating with complex APIs can be quite cumbersome. That is
  true if you talk to BC from e.g. a dedicated frontend or an integration 
 solution as well as talking to another API from BC.If you develop API cli
 ents in BC\, you have to create quite some boilerplate code that doesn't 
 add a lot of value and is annoying and cumbersome to create and maintain.
  In this session\, we will show you a work in progress approach for autom
 ating that process so that you can get API clients with only a few comman
 ds.Once you have your client in BC or somewhere else\, simulating / mocki
 ng complex APIs for test and dev purposes is also not easy. WireMock prov
 ides a free and open-source platform to vastly simplify that job and help
 s both during development and CI. In this session you will understand the
  challenges that WireMock helps you tackle\, you will see a ready-to-use 
 setup to get started and you will get deep insights into how you use it w
 ith comprehensive demos and walkthroughs.\n\nSpeaker(s): Tobias Fenster\,

DESCRIPTION:Unlock the full potential of your AL code by avoiding outdated
  patterns and adopting new\, optimized guidelines. In this session\, we w
 ill dive deep into AL code performance by dissecting the SQL queries unde
 rlying your AL code\, examining commonly used patterns\, evaluating their
  effectiveness\, and running examples to measure performance.Drawing from
  real-world experience\, I'll showcase instances of poorly performing AL 
 code and highlight commonly misused patterns that can hinder performance.
  You'll discover bad practices and gain insight into what happens behind 
 the scenes in Business Central.Beyond performance\, in the second part of
  the session\, I'll introduce new patterns\, guidelines\, and best practi
 ces that are often overlooked!!As someone who has actively contributed to
  new Base Application features\, I've honed my skills in writing optimize
 d code and implementing the latest guidelines. Join this session to eleva
 te your AL code and stay ahead with cutting-edge practices!\n\nSpeaker(s)

DESCRIPTION:If you want quality\, you need tests. If you want maintainabil

 reat... But they’re also boring... 🙄Well\, what if we brought a breath o

 2 months. First\, page scripting. Click\, click\, boom! Test Automated! M
 uch simpler! And now another addition “Data-Driven Testing”. Build one AL
  test but cover multiple test cases! Less coding\, more coverage! Fun!Wel
 l … maybe not “fun”\, but it’s something new and exciting! So if you’d li

 them along your traditional AL tests\, Join this session when we deep div

 re its positive and negative effects on the application?In our session\, 
 we will answer these and many other questions related to table indexing. 
 You will see practical examples of Business Central application code and 
 recommended approach to table indexing for better performance.We will cov

DESCRIPTION:Sure\, it works well for mainstream languages like C#. But AL?
  That quirky language behind Business Central? GitHub Copilot is nothing 
 more than a glorified autocomplete...Or is it?I’m here to show you how Co
 pilot has evolved into so much more over the past year. Sure\, there’s Co
 pilot Chat—cool\, but we’ve all had ChatGPT for a while. The real game-ch
 anger? *Copilot Edits.*This isn’t just code suggestions\; it’s code creat
 ion. Tables\, pages\, codeunits\, subscribers\, tests—all in AL—and guess
  what? They compile. Copilot Edits takes care of the tedious work so you 
 can focus on solving real problems and building what matters.But how does
  it know what you need? And why does it sometimes get it so right — yet o
 ther times\, so painfully wrong?Whether you’re a Copilot enthusiast or a 
 skeptic\, this session will break down not just what it can do\, but why 
 it works. Let me show you why Copilot Edits is the next big leap for AL.\

DESCRIPTION:During this session\, we're going to put "Anything Copilot" to
  the test: from vectorized data to chat-ability. The goal is simple: if t
 here's anything wrong with my Business Central\, I can just ask about it.
 We'll vectorize KQL queries\, query BC Telemetry\, interpret the results 
 with Copilot\, and add some extra cherries on top. Plus\, we'll walk you 
 through how to build such a solution yourself - from start to finish!Join
  us to see how Copilot can revolutionize your Business Central experience
  by making data querying and interpretation as easy as having a conversat
 ion.\n\nSpeaker(s): Eric Wauters (waldo)\, Dmitry Katson

DESCRIPTION:As Business Central continues to evolve in the cloud-first wor

 orms. We'll begin with a deep dive into the "AL way"—exploring using HTTP
 Client and building structured payloads using XML and JSON.From there\, w
 e transition into the modern landscape: decoupled architectures powered b
 y custom APIS\, event-driven logic\, Logic Apps\, and Power Automate. You
 ’ll see real-world examples\, hands-on demonstrations\, and clear side-by
 -side comparisons of each approach's strengths\, limitations\, and best-f
 it scenarios.Whether you're maintaining legacy solutions or architecting 
 new integrations\, this session will give you the insight and tools to co
 nfidently design scalable\, maintainable\, and aligned designs that are s
 calable and aligned with Business Central's future.\nWhat you will learn:
