DESCRIPTION:Historically BC code was never written with testability in min
 d. When coding tests against this code\, it leaves us with ample option t
 han setting up a lot of data before the action under test can be exercise
 d.Ideally you probably would like to refactor your code to comply with SO
 LID principles and make your automated test effort overall much simpler. 
 But often our vast code heritage and new projects ahead do not allow us t
 o get that prioritized and leaves us with non-SOLID code to write test au
 tomation against.In this workshop you will learn about\, and apply\, vari
 ous ways to efficiently set up data when creating automated tests for cod

DESCRIPTION:SOLID principles are key to developing high-quality software\,
  and they're just as relevant in the AL world as anywhere else. In this w
 orkshop\, you'll see firsthand how applying these principles to Business 
 Central development leads to more maintainable\, flexible\, better-struct
 ured code that stands the test of time and adapts easily to new requireme
 nts.The workshop will focus on each of the five SOLID principles: it expl
 ains what they mean in theory\, and shows how to apply it with a lot of p
 ractical\, easy-to-follow examples in AL. The workshop follows a case stu
 dy example\, designed for a comprehensive hands-on experience\, where you
 'll transform an existing AL solution written in traditional way into one
  that applies SOLID principles throughout. This isn't just about making m
 inor adjustments\; it's about reshaping the code entirely to make it more
  robust\, easier to read and maintain\, and efficient to test.By particip
 ating\, you'll gain valuable skills in enhancing the quality and testabil
 ity of your AL code. This workshop is about providing you with the tools 
 and knowledge to write Business Central code that is not only functional 
 but also - well - solid\, on every possible level\, code that's ready for
  the cloud and the challenges of tomorrow's business requirements.\nPrere

 because we are not extinct\, are we? 😉\nThis session is all about embrac
 ing the oh-so-many changes. We'll explore some of the topics that we thin
 k are very important to cover. Obviously not as a deep\, deep dive sessio
 n\, but more like a touch of joy on what has changed and what to look for

DESCRIPTION:Let's face it\, testing AL code isn't exactly the highlight of
  anyone's day. It's often seen as a chore – time-consuming to write and e
 ven more so to run. But what if it didn't have to be that way?This deep d
 ive session is going to change your perspective on unit tests. Forget the
  tedious integration tests\; we're talking about the real champions – sim
 ple\, fast\, and accurate unit tests. They're your first line of defense 
 against those pesky bugs and regressions. You'll see why they're so cruci
 al and how they can actually make your life easier.But the real game-chan
 ger? Test doubles. These are the secret sauce to making testing in AL a w
 alk in the park. This session demystifies them for you – what they are\, 
 the different types there are\, and the right time to use each one for ma
 ximum efficiency.It's not just talk\, though. You'll see a lot of code th
 at will turn your view on both coding and testing upside down! You'll see
  how to tackle dependencies\, and how to interact with the base and syste
 m apps in a clean\, testable way. And yes\, we'll answer that burning que
 stion: can you really trust test doubles and what is it that you are trul
 y testing?Join this session and learn how to elevate your testing game in
  AL. It's all about writing clean\, efficient\, robust\, code and sharp\,
  focused\, meaningful tests that don't feel like a drag.\n\nSpeaker(s): V

DESCRIPTION:Ever searched YouTube for "Power Automate flows"? There are 10
 0s of videos\, maybe more! Try searching for "Power Automate flows for Bu
 siness Central" and you'll find about a dozen. And most of them focus on 
 the simple demo examples of Workflow approval or create flows using out-o
 f-the-box BC API pages.\nGreat for some demo magic\, but it doesn't get y
 ou very far when you need to create flows for the real world.\nHere's whe
 re I can help. I'll teach you how to use data from your custom tables and
  pages\, and call bound actions to run code in Business Central from your
  Power Automate flow.\nAnd best of all\, it's not really that hard once y

DESCRIPTION:Are you using the HttpClient in AL? And are you using it in th

 oks quite straightforward\, right? However\, some underlying issues go un
 noticed until you use the HttpClient under a heavier load. And when you r
 un into those issues\, you may have less time to figure out what's happen
 ing. Solving those issues might even require a redesign of the code. So y
 ou better do it right from the beginning!In this session\, we will look i
 nto those potential issues and show the best way of using the HttpClient 
 in your solution. We will also look into the new Rest Client module in th

DESCRIPTION:The move from C/AL to AL brought many new development paradigm
 s to our industry. Source Control\, Extensions\, Cloud-first approach\, j
 ust to name a few.\nOne of them is also the Code Review which is a huge a
 ddition to code quality. The change happened a few years ago and partners
  adopted many different approaches to Code Reviews. But Code Reviews aren
 ’t new\, many mature industries have been using them for decades\, and no
 w AI is supposed to help with that as well.\nI believe now is a good time
  to stop for a moment\, review our code review processes\, and talk about
  best practices. How to ensure code reviews are not overwhelming? What ar
 e communication best practices\, so the comments are well received? How t
 o prevent “rubber stamping” pull requests? What tools can make them more 
 manageable? How can the GitHub Copilot help with all of that?\nJoin the s

DESCRIPTION:Modern Business Central solutions typically are composed of mu
 ltiple extensions\, but also external integrations to some kind of webser
 vice\, other 3rd-party components or even alternative frontends become mo
 re and more common. While we have established ideas how to assure the qua
 lity of the BC components\, it often is not as clear what we should do to
  also make sure the rest has the required quality level.In this session w
 e will look at different scenarios\, covering frontend and performance te
 sting\, but also a bit of chaos engineering. Afterwards\, you should have
  a good idea how to approach quality assurance outside of BC as well.\n\n
