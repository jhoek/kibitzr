DESCRIPTION:Microsoft's Center of Excellence Starter Kit provide amazing c
 omponents to leverage the adoption\, administration\, governance and nurt
 uring of the Power Platform. An important one is the ALM Accelerator for 
 Power Platform. This solution helps Makers as well as Pro-Developers to e
 stablish an enterprise grade Application Lifecycle Management process for
  their Dataverse solutions.In my session you gain a brief understanding o
 f the ALM basics in Dataverse. I will explain why it makes sense to have 
 a clear environment strategy. Furthermore I'll show you\, how I use solut
 ions to pack and transport my PowerApps and Power Automate flows between 
 my Dataverse environments. After clarifying these concepts\, I will give 
 you a deep-dive into Microsoft's ALM Accelerator for Power Platform. I ex
 plain in demos\, how a fully automated ALM process works.\n\nSpeaker(s):

DESCRIPTION:We can implement the most astonishing design patterns\, or the
  most complex and nerdy design guidelines. But when we forget about "perf
 ormance"\, all of that goes to waste. But what does "thinking about perfo
 rmance" really mean? Does that mean we need to prevent any kind of perfor
 mance problems? Or do we have to be able to efficiently react when we hav
 e problems? I can tell you already: the answer is "both"! During this ses
 sion\, I'm going to go through performance-scenarios that we all encounte
 r during our life in Business Central. Some obvious\, some less obvious\,
  some completely unexpected. While analysing the scenarios\, we'll use so
 me interesting tools along the way that are indispensable for an efficien
 t analysis or solution to performance related problems.\n\nSpeaker(s): Er

DESCRIPTION:Telemetry gives developers\, as well as decision-makers\, the 
 advantage that we did not have in past in the NAV world. It allows to rea
 ct quicker on errors\, allows to monitor the usage of the solutions\, and
  control if everything works correctly. In other words\, it can save us a
  lot of time and stress if we know how to use it.In the session\, we will
  present how to use telemetry for troubleshooting\, how to create in easy
  way notifications about the issues\, and how to use telemetry to make de
 cisions about the application if you are the ISV or VAR. This will be an 
 interactive session with live questions and the ability to interact with 
 what is presented.\n\nSpeaker(s): Krzysztof Bialowas\, Kennie Pontoppidan
