DESCRIPTION:Are you ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into the coding
  trenches with true OGs? This session is FOR OGs\, by OGs. And if you don
 't know what that stands for: "Original Gangsters." No\, not dinosaurs\, 
 because we are not extinct\, are we? 😉\nThis session is all about embrac
 ing the oh-so-many changes. We'll explore some of the topics that we thin
 k are very important to cover. Obviously not as a deep\, deep dive sessio
 n\, but more like a touch of joy on what has changed and what to look for
 ward to\, like:\nThere might be more\, there might be less - we'll see - 
 gansta style!\nWhether you're an OG yourself or just starting out\, come 
 prepared to learn\, laugh\, and leave with some serious coding swagger (p
 un intended).\n\nSpeaker(s): Eric Wauters (waldo)\, Arend-Jan Kauffmann

DESCRIPTION:Let's face it\, testing AL code isn't exactly the highlight of
  anyone's day. It's often seen as a chore – time-consuming to write and e
 ven more so to run. But what if it didn't have to be that way?This deep d
 ive session is going to change your perspective on unit tests. Forget the
  tedious integration tests\; we're talking about the real champions – sim
 ple\, fast\, and accurate unit tests. They're your first line of defense 
 against those pesky bugs and regressions. You'll see why they're so cruci
 al and how they can actually make your life easier.But the real game-chan
 ger? Test doubles. These are the secret sauce to making testing in AL a w
 alk in the park. This session demystifies them for you – what they are\, 
 the different types there are\, and the right time to use each one for ma
 ximum efficiency.It's not just talk\, though. You'll see a lot of code th
 at will turn your view on both coding and testing upside down! You'll see
  how to tackle dependencies\, and how to interact with the base and syste
 m apps in a clean\, testable way. And yes\, we'll answer that burning que
 stion: can you really trust test doubles and what is it that you are trul
 y testing?Join this session and learn how to elevate your testing game in
  AL. It's all about writing clean\, efficient\, robust\, code and sharp\,
  focused\, meaningful tests that don't feel like a drag.\n\nSpeaker(s): V

DESCRIPTION:You are probably already tired of listening to sessions about 
 clean code by now. BUT HEAR US OUT!Imagine a world where a user can choos
 e to not validate fields. Imagine the chaos. Imagine the support tickets.
 Now why should developers decide to not validate? Because developers know
  all the code? Maybe back in the days but certainly not today!We would li
 ke to show you our idea on how to validate and explain why we think it's 
 important.We prepared some real life examples\, broken code\, infinite lo

DESCRIPTION:Ever searched YouTube for "Power Automate flows"? There are 10
 0s of videos\, maybe more! Try searching for "Power Automate flows for Bu
 siness Central" and you'll find about a dozen. And most of them focus on 
 the simple demo examples of Workflow approval or create flows using out-o
 f-the-box BC API pages.\nGreat for some demo magic\, but it doesn't get y
 ou very far when you need to create flows for the real world.\nHere's whe
 re I can help. I'll teach you how to use data from your custom tables and
  pages\, and call bound actions to run code in Business Central from your
  Power Automate flow.\nAnd best of all\, it's not really that hard once y
 ou learn how it's done. No fluff\, no kool-aid\, just real talk and real 
 examples.\n\nSpeaker(s): AJ Ansari

DESCRIPTION:Are you using the HttpClient in AL? And are you using it in th
 e right way? You may think that if it works\, then it should be ok. It lo
 oks quite straightforward\, right? However\, some underlying issues go un
 noticed until you use the HttpClient under a heavier load. And when you r
 un into those issues\, you may have less time to figure out what's happen
 ing. Solving those issues might even require a redesign of the code. So y
 ou better do it right from the beginning!In this session\, we will look i
 nto those potential issues and show the best way of using the HttpClient 
 in your solution. We will also look into the new Rest Client module in th
 e system app and how to implement that in your solution. Including a snea
 k peek into a module that pushes the Rest Client module to the next level

  actions you can take\, such as using strong authentication methods\, and

DESCRIPTION:If you want to maximize the throughput of your Business Centra
 l online environments\, then this session is for you.The Business Central
  online service scales automatically to accommodate the load you throw at
  it\, and we will explain how it does that.Does this mean that you can ne
 ver have problems with performance in BC online? Of course not. The respo
 nsibility for getting high throughput is shared between Microsoft and par
 tners\, and we will cover design and configuration patterns for achieving
  high throughput as well as ways to troubleshoot when performance problem
 s do appear.\n\nSpeaker(s): Christian Heide Damm\, Maria Zaharia Rusu\, R

DESCRIPTION:The move from C/AL to AL brought many new development paradigm
 s to our industry. Source Control\, Extensions\, Cloud-first approach\, j
 ust to name a few.\nOne of them is also the Code Review which is a huge a
 ddition to code quality. The change happened a few years ago and partners
  adopted many different approaches to Code Reviews. But Code Reviews aren
 ’t new\, many mature industries have been using them for decades\, and no
 w AI is supposed to help with that as well.\nI believe now is a good time
  to stop for a moment\, review our code review processes\, and talk about
  best practices. How to ensure code reviews are not overwhelming? What ar
 e communication best practices\, so the comments are well received? How t
 o prevent “rubber stamping” pull requests? What tools can make them more 
 manageable? How can the GitHub Copilot help with all of that?\nJoin the s
 ession to see how we can take the effectiveness of code reviews to anothe
 r level.\n\nSpeaker(s): Tine Starič

DESCRIPTION:Modern Business Central solutions typically are composed of mu
 ltiple extensions\, but also external integrations to some kind of webser
 vice\, other 3rd-party components or even alternative frontends become mo
 re and more common. While we have established ideas how to assure the qua
 lity of the BC components\, it often is not as clear what we should do to
  also make sure the rest has the required quality level.In this session w
 e will look at different scenarios\, covering frontend and performance te
 sting\, but also a bit of chaos engineering. Afterwards\, you should have
  a good idea how to approach quality assurance outside of BC as well.\n\n
